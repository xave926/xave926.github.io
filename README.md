**These are the parts and what does the parts do**

**Headstock** - Headstock. At the top of the neck is the headstock or peghead of the guitar, which holds the tuning pegs and keys that allow the guitar to be tuned. Headstocks can be straight or angled, and come in many different shapes depending on maker and model.

**Tuning Machines** - The tuning pegs are located on the head of the guitar, and change the pitch of the guitar strings. To make the pitch go up, turn the pegs to tighten the strings. To make the pitch go down, turn the pegs to loosen the strings.

**Nut** - A nut, on a guitar, is a small piece of hard material that supports the strings at the end closest to the headstock or scroll.

**Neck** - The neck of a guitar is the long, thin piece of wood between the headstock and the body where you'll find the fretboard, frets, and truss rod. Necks are typically attached to the body with bolts, glue, or sometimes both.

**Fretboard** - The fretboard also known as a fingerboard on fretted instruments) is an important component of most stringed instruments. It is a thin, long strip of material, usually wood, that is laminated to the front of the neck of an instrument. The strings run over the fingerboard, between the nut and bridge.
